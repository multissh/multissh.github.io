## How to Use

Follow these steps to get started with MultiSSH:

### Sign In

1. Visit [multissh.github.io](https://multissh.github.io).
2. Click on the "Sign In" button.
3. Enter your username and key:
    - Username: `demo`
    - Key: `dTAu1iOvOfxQ63BZsYQpDqvyHMjeD8itjZ7GTs`
4. Click on the "Sign In" button to log in.

- To generate a key, you can build your own instance of [server-multissh](https://github.com/multissh/server-multissh). Follow the instructions in the repository to set up and configure your server.

1. After signing in, click on the "Server" button.
2. Enter your token and the URL of your server list:
    - Token: `ghp_xxxxxx`
    - URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/multissh/repo/main/multissh/server.txt`
3. Click on the "Save" button to add the server.

### Server Configuration Format
The `server.txt` file is used to configure the servers that the application will connect to. Each server is represented by one or more lines in the file. 

server.txt format:

```txt
# [Server Name]
[username]:[password]||[ip address]:[port]
```

Here's an example configuration:
```
# vps1
root:xxxxx||127.0.0.1:22
root:xxxxx||127.0.0.1:22

# vps2
root:xxxxx||127.0.0.1:22
```

In this example, the application will connect to three servers. The first two servers are grouped under the name "vps1", and the third server is named "vps2". All servers use the username "root" and the password "password123" for authentication. just create on your private repos

### Add Snippet

    - URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/multissh/repo/main/multissh/snippets.sh`
3. Click on the "Save" button to add the snippet.

### snippets.sh Format
The `snippets.sh` file is used to define the snippets that the application will execute. Each snippet is represented by one or more lines in the file.

```sh
# [Snippet Name]
[Command]
```
example configuration with two snippets:
```sh
# uptime
uptime

# check screen
